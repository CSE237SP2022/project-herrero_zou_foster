We completed the implementation of the character and item classes. The user will create a character at the beginning of the game which they will play as throughout the game. Each character comes with a number of attributes which they measure the strength of their character. Items are also another large part of the game as the user can use them to augment their character and improve their strength. We also created a battle class which simply serves as our main method right now to test our code.

In our next iteration we intend to complete the feature where users can intialize and customize their attributes at the beginning of the game. We will also add more classes to represent encounters and monsters the player may face throughout the game. We will also add different classes that the player can choose that will fit their playstyle and how those classes will affect attributes respectively.
